## VMG AI MATURITY ASSESSMENT

---

## Executive Summary

As an AI-first consulting startup, Velocity MG presents an interesting maturity profile. While we have exceptionally strong vision and strategy (Level 4), our execution capabilities are still developing (Levels 1-3).

This creates an "At Risk" maturity state - not due to lack of direction, but because our ambitious vision is ahead of our current operational capabilities. This is expected for a startup, provided we execute on building our capabilities to match our strategic ambition.

**Overall Maturity: 2.4 (Transitioning from Reactive to Proactive)**  
**Health Status: At Risk (Vision appropriately leading, execution building)**

## Detailed Maturity Assessment by Building Block

| Building Block | Current Level | Score | Target (12 mo) | Rationale |
|----------------|---------------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Vision** | Managed | 4.0 | 4.0 | **Strength:** Clear, compelling vision of "Velocity Made Good" - using AI to ensure SMBs achieve strategic goals, not just implement technology. Vision directly addresses market need and is championed by leadership. |
| **Strategy** | Managed | 3.5 | 4.0 | **Strength:** Well-articulated strategy to deliver enterprise consulting at SMB prices through AI. Strategy is living document, but needs more market validation and iteration. |
| **Metrics** | Reactive | 2.0 | 3.5 | **Gap:** Basic financial metrics in place, but lacking comprehensive KPIs for AI value delivery, client success prediction, and operational efficiency. Building measurement infrastructure. |
| **Governance** | Aware/Reactive | 1.5 | 3.0 | **Gap:** Minimal formal governance as startup. Have basic data privacy policies, but need formal AI ethics guidelines, decision rights, and quality assurance processes. |
| **People** | Reactive | 2.0 | 3.0 | **Reality:** Small founding team with strong vision but limited bandwidth. AI expertise concentrated in 1-2 people. Need to build team and distribute AI capabilities. |
| **Processes** | Aware/Reactive | 1.5 | 3.0 | **Gap:** Ad-hoc processes typical of startup. Some documented methodologies but inconsistent application. Need to standardize delivery while maintaining agility. |
| **Technology** | Reactive/Proactive | 2.5 | 4.0 | **Mixed:** Good foundational AI tools (Claude, python, n8n, superset analytics platforms) but lacking integrated platform. Infrastructure can support current scale but needs architecture for growth. |

## Conclusion

VMG's maturity profile is what you'd expect from a visionary AI-first startup: strong strategic direction with developing execution capabilities.

Our "At Risk" status isn't a weakness - it's a natural state that provides clear priorities for investment. The key is to build execution capabilities systematically while maintaining the vision and agility that make us unique.

**Bottom Line:** We know where we're going (Vision), we know how to get there (Strategy), and now we need to build the engine (Operations) to make the journey at scale.
